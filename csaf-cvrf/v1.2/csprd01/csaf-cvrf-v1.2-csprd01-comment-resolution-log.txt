Submitter's message

Approval due to observation of two facts: 1)Archive folder for June 2016 of the public comments list at https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/csaf-comment/201706/maillist.html only contains the announcement message and 2) there is no folder for July 2017 (on 2017-07-21 09:14 UTC), thus no comment received in July part of period. 

We received one TC internal comment with purely editorial content ("no technical corrections/comments") from Beth Pumo (https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/csaf/201707/msg00003.html) that the editor intents to implement as non-material changes revision as candidate for balloting and further progression in the OASIS standards creation process.
