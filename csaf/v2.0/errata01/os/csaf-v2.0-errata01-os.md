# 1 Introduction

This document lists the approved changes to the OASIS Standard _Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0_, consisting of the following components:
* _Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0_ (prose document)
* Aggregator JSON schema
* CSAF JSON schema
* Provider JSON schema

There are no changes to the published CSAF document. Changes have been made only to the included Aggregator JSON schema. No changes have been made to the other two included JSON schemas.

## 1.1 Description of changes

In the aggregator schema, a typo has been corrected that blocked creation of any valid JSON aggregator document instance.

In line 178 of the `aggregator_json_schema.json`, the entry `mirror` as `required` field has been corrected to be `mirrors` to match the existing property definition in line 187 of the same schema file. There is no field `mirror`.

## 1.2 Scope of changes

The only approved change is to the Aggregator JSON schema file, "aggregator_json_schema.json".
The corrected file is linked in the section [Additional artifacts](#additional-artifacts) on the title page.

# 2 Conformance

The conformance requirements stated in the OASIS Standard _Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0_ [[csaf-v2.0-os](#csaf-v20-os)] are not changed in any way by the publication of this Errata document.

As stated in the OASIS IPR Policy, the following three paragraphs in brackets apply to OASIS Standards Final Deliverable documents (Committee Specification, Candidate OASIS Standard, OASIS Standard, or Approved Errata).

[OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this deliverable.]

[OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.]

[OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.]
